<h1 class="h5">App Info</h1>
<p class="my-3">
	Each message is encrypted/decrypted locally, on browser, by using the AES-256 algorithm in GCM mode.
	<br />
	Remote server is only used to store the encrypted message, so it can be later retrieved by a third person.
	<br />
	Sender has the ability to receive a delivery notification on his browser once his message is read by a recipient.
	<br />
	The encryption key which is used to encrypt/decrypt a message is locally created on user's browser and never gets exposed to server.
	<br />
	Every generated message is removed from server upon its retrieval. Also, unread messages are automatically destroyed 1 hour after their creation timestamp.
	<br />
	All of the above makes message creation, transmission and retrieval extremely secure, where data breach practically becomes impossible.

			What data does server store?
		</ng-template>

		<ng-template ngbPanelContent>
			The server stores only the minimum information required from the encryption library to decrypt the message, based on the data that was originally used to encrypt it.
			<br />
			Stored object: {{'{'}} IV, Salt, CT {{'}'}} where IV = 'Initialization Vector', CT = 'Cipher Text'.
